## Pull Request Rules

To maintain the quality and consistency of this project, please follow these rules when creating a Pull Request (PR):

### 1. Branch Naming Convention
- Use a consistent branch naming convention:
  - `feature/<branch-name>` for new features.
  - `bugfix/<branch-name>` for bug fixes.
  - `hotfix/<branch-name>` for urgent fixes.
  - `docs/<branch-name>` for documentation updates.

### 2. Pull Request Description
- Every PR must have a clear description including:
  - **Summary**: What the PR does.
  - **Related Issue(s)**: Links to issues addressed by the PR (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
  - **Testing Instructions**: Steps to test the changes.
  - **Screenshots** (if applicable).

### 3. Code Review and Approval
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one collaborator before merging.
- Address all review comments before requesting final approval.

### 4. CI/CD and Status Checks
- Ensure all CI/CD checks pass before merging, including:
  - Build success.
  - All tests pass.
  - Linting and formatting checks.

### 5. Keep PRs Small and Focused
- Submit PRs that focus on a single feature, bug fix, or change.
- Avoid combining unrelated changes into one PR.

### 6. Use Draft PRs for Work-in-Progress
- Use **Draft PRs** for incomplete work and convert them to regular PRs when ready for review.

### 7. No Direct Merges to Protected Branches
- All changes to key branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`) must go through a pull request.

### 8. Conflict Resolution
- The PR author is responsible for resolving any merge conflicts before the PR is reviewed or merged.

### 9. Testing
- Add or update tests to cover new functionality or changes.
- Ensure all existing tests pass.

### 10. Documentation
- Update relevant documentation (e.g., README, API docs) if the changes impact the project's functionality.
